Frances Wong is an assistant professor, teaching stream, at the University of Toronto
Mississauga Department of Biology. She is interested in how dynamic cell populations make
decisions (sometimes incorrectly!) during development. Frances used a systems biology
approach to investigate human placenta development by isolating single cells at multiple time
points during early development to computationally assemble a cell atlas of first trimester
development. Currently, Frances incorporates computational literacy as a core course
objective in biology courses she teaches to empower over 1000 students to analyze the data
they collect each semester.

Andres is a Software Engineer with a MSc in Business Information Technologies, who is
currently pursuing his PhD in Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto. Previously,
Andres was a professor and project coordinator for programming courses at Universidad de
Los Andes, Colombia. His main interests are Artificial Intelligence, software development, and
data analytics. Currently, his PhD project applies AI, specifically Natural Language
Processing, Large Language Models and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, to
healthcare scenarios.

Amin is a bioinformatician at Princess Margaret Genomic Centre (PMGC) who is also
pursuing his master's degree at Olson Lab at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU). Prior to
his current roles, he earned his bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics and started his current
position at PMGC in 2022. His expertise includes analyzing various types of data, including
epigenomics and genomics, from raw data to visualization. His master's project focuses on
exploring gene expression data in ovarian cancer cell lines, as well as image classification to
determine whether cell images have been treated with various compounds.
